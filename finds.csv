The corroded remains of a ferrous metal implement are retained within a pressed metal three-sided handle, open on the fourth side, and with an expanded end and open circular terminal. A suspension loop of drawn wire is located at the other end. Stamped vegetal decorative motifs appear on both sides of the handle. The metal implement was presumably a blade and spike for cutting tobacco and reaming out a pipe while the rounded end would be used as a tamper. It would function in much the same way as a penknife, with implements folded out of the handle on its open side. Suggested date: Post-Medieval, 1800-1900.

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb3a4),FIGURINE,POST MEDIEVAL,"A copper alloy figurine of possible post-medieval date. The figurine is anthropomorphic (human like), consisting of a standing female figure. The head is globular. No facial details remain. The arms are at her sides, slightly away from her body in a welcoming gesture. The figure's right knee is slightly bent inwards. At the rear of the object a central groove defines the back which curves outwards at the waist emphasising the figure's posterior. Between the hips a hole is drilled through the figure measuring 4mm in diameter.

Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the plough soil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail. The hole could suggest that this is a figurine of Venus but due to the simplistic style of the artefact, this identification is tentative. The reddish patina and condition of the metal suggests a post-medieval date. Casting seems are visible down the sides of the figure.

It is a flat, rectangular token with a raised border and depicts two naked figures performing a sexual act.

The scene shows a tree or cave wall emerging from the ground on the right-hand side of the scene. The canopy at the top is present but the detail isn't clear. Standing on the ground and beneath the canopy area, a male and female figure are depicted engaged in sexual intercourse. The female's buttocks are pressed against the tree/cave side, and she is supporting her weight on her right leg while the left leg is raised and supported by the cradling arm of the male. Her upper torso is leaning forward, kissing the male and her arms appear to be wrapped around either the upper torso of the male or at his neck and shoulders. The male stands on both feet, the right leg bent slightly back, his arm cradling the woman's left leg as his phallus penetrates the woman. The whole scene is surrounded by a rectangular border. The reverse is undecorated. The top right and bottom left corners have been bent towards the reverse of the object giving it a convex appearance. 

The object measures 50.3 mm in length and is 37.7 mm wide. It has a thickness of 4.7 mm and weighs 72.9 g.

The object is a mid grey in colour and has an even patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.

The spout is circular in section and curves downwards to allow the flow of liquid. Above this there would have been a small squared protrusion, which is believed to have been the focus of the hammer striking the tap into a barrel - this is now missing and only the lower moulding survives.

In the Museum of London's ""Medieval Catalogue"" (1940, p133-144), Ward Perkins has introduced a classification system for door and chest keys. The key described in this record is most closely related to his Type VI, but the stem differs in that it appears to be hollow for the whole length. Ward Perkins describes the type: ""They are characterized by the solid shank, bored at the end to leave a conical hole, by the massive bit, and by the elaborate form of the bow. The latter may be lobed or lozenge-shaped or a combination of both, and occasionally the corners of the lozenge are elaborated"" (p140). Ward Perkins dates a number of closely related copper alloy keys of Type VI to the 14th and 15th centuries, and this may be an appropriate date range for this key.

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb3bd),PIPE (SMOKING),POST MEDIEVAL,"David Higgins reports ""A complete pipe bowl with 74mm of surviving stem (2 7/8"") and a stem bore of 8/64"" was found on the beach at Haverigg, to the south-west side of the Lake District in Cumbria. The whole fragment has been very abraded by wave action so that all of the original external surface has been lost. It is possible, however, to make out traces of a band of milling at the bowl rim and it is possible that the faint 'shadow' of a circular maker's mark survives on the heel, but this is now completely illegible. Discolouration inside the bowl shows that the pipe has been smoked. The white fabric of which it is made is quite fine, with the only inclusions visible under a 10x lens being sparse rounded grains of what appears to be quartz (sand). The bowl form (Merseyside Type H7/H8 of c1640-1670; cf Higgins 2008, 147) is characteristic of the south Lancashire industry, which was centred on Rainford, about 12 miles to the north-east of Liverpool, and this is the likely origin of the pipe. Seventeenth century Rainford pipes were extensively traded across the areas now occupied by Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Lancashire and as far north into Cumbria as the southern Lakes. Although quite a long stem section survives, this only represents a proportion of the original pipe, with contemporary examples having stems ranging from around 6½"" to 12½"" in length (165-315mm; Higgins 1987, 64).""",,,Copeland,,,,1640,,https://finds.org.uk/images/Susie White/medium/LVPLA1A2D7a.jpg,Chance find during metal detecting,Returned to finder

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb3c0),PIPE (SMOKING),POST MEDIEVAL,"An incomplete moulded clay tobacco pipe bowl of Post Medieval dating, circa 17th Century.

The pipe fragment consists of a complete bowl with an incomplete stem. The rim of the bowl is still intact. The back of the bowl has been stamped with an 'RG' mark with three small pellets in light relief below. Another stamp is located on the base of the heel although this has been worn and is difficult to distinguish. There are possibly additional initials, although all that is clear are four small pellets below. The pipe is decorated with a horizontal rouletted line running approximately parallel to the rim edge. The pattern is uneven as it curves around the bowl. The clay tobacco pipe has been moulded from a white pipeclay. The surface is uneven and pitted.

The rouletting decoration can be seen on another example recorded by the PAS from the West Midlands (WMID-0A73F6). The bowl is similar to an Oswald type 5 (Oswald, 1975, 37), which typically dates from c. AD 1640-1660 with the expanded bowl and flat base and rouletted rim. 

The clay pipe measures 25.16mm high, 18.1mm wide, 44.63mm long, with a maximum diameter of 15.56mm. The wall of the clay pipe bowl is 2.53mm thick. It weighs 7.9 grams.

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb3c3),CLAY PIPE (SMOKING),POST MEDIEVAL,"An incomplete clay pipe of early modern date (1805-32), missing most of the stem (old break) and with some damage to the bowl at its mouth to one side only (recent-ish break). The heel is missing (recent-ish break).
The casting seam is clearly visible. To the outside of the bowl it is flanked alternately by moulded ears of corn and V-shaped ribs. Beyond the ears of corn three pellets extend linearly, where there is room and the space is not taken up with other decoration on the bowl. To the inside of the bowl the casting seam is flanked by two joining halves of a lozenge around a central moulded ring with radiating lines, possibly imitating the sun. The two lower outlines of the lozenge are slightly wider than those above and decorated with transverse ribs. Instead of the lower and upper edges joining, both extend a little way beyond.
The complete side of the bowl has a moulded rim and depicts three towers in an inverted-V formation, with a six-pointed mullet below the central tower and a raised inverted-V below. This has ribbed edges and a central ribbed inverted-V. Below is an apparent saltire cross with one bar much wider than the other. The stem to this half of the clay pipe is decorated with alternating pairs of leaves (three) and V-shapes with curled over ends (two) preceding the letters GO before the break.
The damaged side of the bowl features at the centre an inverted and raised T-shape, possibly a hammer or implement of some kind. Below is a grouping of motifs crossing one another - a short diagonal raised bar with transverse ribs, a narrow rib vertically and equidistant in the spaces either side a raised pellet and a leaf-shape. Around the break a curving rib extends with bifurcated end, close to the outside of the bowl. Above the upper edge of the lozenge are two six-pointed mullets. The stem to this half of the clay pipe is decorated as the other side, but after the letters AM which are at the break (the A is incomplete and consist of one diagonal stroke only).
The clay pipe measures 54.4mm in incomplete length, 19.8mm in width and stands 35.8mm in height. The bowl measures 20.2x21.1mm (internal 16.2x16.9mm). The clay pipe weighs 9.26g.

David Higgins comments:

A damaged pipe bowl and part of the stem, with relief moulded decoration and part of the maker's name surviving. The bowl is decorated with Masonic symbols, which were very popular motifs on English pipes during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This example has a style and arrangement of motifs that is typical of London and the south coast, and the damaged top of the right hand side would have included seven stars and a moon originally. The heel (which would have carried the maker's initials) has been broken off from beneath the bowl. The first part of the stem is decorated with a relief moulded spray of foliage in a style that is typical of the early nineteenth century and the very end of some lettering that would have comprised the maker's surname and place of work (GO./ /.AM). This bowl can be matched with a complete example illustrated by Fox and Hall (1979, Fig 17.115), which shows that the heel would have originally have been marked IG and the full lettering on the stem would have read GOODALL / FAREHAM. This pipe can be attributed to either one of the John Goodalls (I or II; recorded working 1805-31) or James Goodall (recorded working 1829-1832), all of Fareham (Fox &amp; Hall 1979, 21). The pipe was found about 15 miles to the north of Fareham, which is within the 15-20 mile radius from the place of manufacture that is a typical distribution area for inland pipes at this period.

The mouth of the bowl is incomplete due to recent damage and is decorated with a circumferential ridge where visible. There is a small round spur at the base of the bowl measuring 4mm in length which is incomplete. The bowl has an internal diameter of 16.5mm.

Dr David Higgins comments: Stylistically the pipe bowl dates from around 1820-50 and it was almost certainly made by a member of the Morgan family, since the Morgans were one of the principal pipemaking families in Liverpool during the early nineteenth century. Furthermore, this mark has previously been recorded from Liverpool and there are not any other recorded Liverpool pipemakers with the initials JM who are not members of this family. If the bowl was made by one of the Morgans, then it is likely to date from the 1820s or early 1830s, since the family appears to have given up pipemaking by 1840. There are four or five members of the family working during the early nineteenth century with the initials JM as follows: -

James Morgan, recorded working in 1803

John Morgan, recorded working 1800-1804 and 1827-1834 (possibly two different individuals)

Joseph Morgan, recorded working 1815-1817

Judith Morgan, recorded working 1810-1832

Given the date of the bowl and mark type, then this is most likely to be a product of either John or Judith Morgan and to date from c1820-35.",,,West Lancashire,,,,1820,,https://finds.org.uk/images/voakden/medium/LVPL947772.jpg,Metal detector,Returned to finder

The bezel is decorated with a low-relief beaded border within which there is a low-relief initial of I and C which, between them, has a vertical, linear motif with a interlace design at the base and at the upper terminal has a triangle and cross design. The central motif may represent a merchants mark.

The surface of the item has a shiny mottled mid green patina on the internal surface, but is abraded across the bezel.

The item measures 21.5mm long across the shoulders, 14.58mm wide across the bezel. It weighs 3.76g. 

This is probably a pipe tamper rather than just a finger ring as these appear to be more common with this style of decoration. Similar pipe tampers incorporating finger-rings have been recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database: For example, see finds: BERK-3D22B1; HESH-7E11A4;IOW-9318E7; LVPL-3BD087; LVPL-A563A1; SF-7096BD; SOM-1556F1; SUSS-373EA5;SWYOR-4BBAD6; SWYOR-D0A4F1 and WAW-416CA5. According to SUSS-373EA5, the two artefacts; finger ring and pipe tamper, were often combined in the 17th century, as apparently gentlemen would often loose their pipe tamper having had too much to drink. With such an artefact the user could wear his ring and conceal the tamper in his palm.",,,Warwick,"Beausale, Haseley, Honiley and Wroxall",52.34567559,-1.693155,1600,,https://finds.org.uk/images/abolton/medium/WAW246B87.jpg,Metal detector,Returned to finder

There is a circumferentical groove just below the cross hatch design. The object tapers into a narrow stomach which is D-shaped in cross section with a circular annulet (pellet inside an incised circle) depression representing the navel. Below the naval the female genitalia are emphasised before the object divides forming two legs which are bent at the knee. The feet which are small and rounded are facing outwards, and are crossed with the right foot on top. The reverse of the object is convex in places to represent the bottom and the calf muscle.

2. A stem dating to c. 1700-1800.

3. A stem with a copper alloy ring on its terminal. This stem bears the inscription GAMBIER/1553 // A PARIS.

This is part of a clay tobacco pipe made by the French firm of Gambier (1780-1926), who were one of the largest manufacturers and exporters of pipes from that country. The company was based at Givet in the Ardennes but had agents in the some of the principal British cities during the second half of the nineteenth century to take care of their trading activities. Most of their later products had a pattern number moulded on them, which can be used to help identify and date the pipes by reference to surviving trade catalogues (see www.gambierpipes.com/) . This particular piece comes from a mounted pipe, i.e., the pipe bowl was made with a short stem that was fitted with a separate mouthpiece, usually of vulcanite, using a metal ferrule, traces of which survive. The stem is clearly marked GAMBIER / A PARIS, together with the pattern number 1553. This pattern was known as 'oeuf sans points' and had a smooth egg-shaped bowl with the stem coming off it at an angle of about 45 degrees.

Suggestive of movement, his right leg is placed ahead of his left; as noted, both of these have about a quarter of their original length broken away in post-depositional damage and are subsequently missing their feet and a portion of the lower legs. The body of the figurine demonstrates evidence of a pot belly, with fairly prominent male genetalia in addition to this. On the back of the figurine, a pair of wings project from the shoulders, and it is these along with the presence of a quiver suspended on his right thigh by a baldrick that runs across his chest and around his back that identify Cupid as the individual portrayed.

Standing on the ground and beneath the canopy area, a male and female figure are depicted engaged in sexual intercourse. The female's buttocks are pressed against the tree/cave side, and she is supporting her weight on her right leg while the left leg is raised and supported by the cradling arm of the male. Her upper torso is leaning forward, kissing the male and her arms appear to be wrapped around either the upper torso of the male or at his neck and shoulders. The male stands on both feet, the right leg bent slightly back, his arm cradling the woman's left leg as his phallus penetrates the woman. The whole scene is surrounded by a rectangular border.

The scene shows a tree or cave wall emerging from the ground on the right-hand side of the scene. The top of the tree/cave is formed of five raised oval pellets. Standing on the ground and beneath the canopy area, a male and female figure are depicted engaged in sexual intercourse. The female's buttocks are pressed against the tree/cave side, and she is supporting her weight on one leg (her right leg) while the left leg is raised and supported by the cradling arm of the male. Her upper torso is leaning forward, kissing the male and her arms appear to be wrapped around the back of the man. The male stands on both feet, the right leg bent slightly back, his arm cradling the woman's left leg as his phallus penetrates the woman. The reverse is undecorated and flat.

The bawdy or erotic scene depicted can be found on pipe tampers such as WMID-786656, NCL-739535, SF-EE2934, SUR-9657B6 and WILT-FE9706.

If not a scene portraying rustic romance, it may be depicting the consummation of Aeneas and Dido in the cave during a hunt while caught in a storm. The background scene may be a cave or a forest, the cave being the actual location of the consummation, the forest alluding to the hunt during which the episode took place. If the latter, this would place the pipe tamper in both the classicizing examples of such objects, as well as the bawdy.

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb417),PIPE TAMPER,POST MEDIEVAL,"A complete copper alloy pipe tamper or combination tool of the Post Medieval Period, circa AD 1600 - AD 1800.

The object is irregular in shape and circular in cross section. At the very top of the implement is a conical point, this bends to the left, possibly damage sustained whilst in the plough soil. The point widens towards the base. At the base of the conical point is a rectangular shaped section with a circular perforation cast in the centre, where it slots onto the point. This rectangular section is decorated with one circular protruding knop, one on each end of the rectangle and below with conical shaped points that bend inwards. There are also two incised grooves at each end of the rectangle and this is mirrored on the reverse of the object. The conical point continues a little way below the rectangular section (which is at a 90 degree angle to the rest of the object), it ends in a ridge. The base has a globe and ridge design created by three globular sections, split by two evenly spaced ridges. The base globe does not have a collar below it instead the base of the globe tapers in then out to form the base of the tamper.

The object measures 54.4 mm long (shaft: 30.0 mm and the conical point is 24.3 mm), it is 14.9 mm wide (the point is 3 mm wide and the shaft is 7.4 mm wide). It has a thickness of 6.4 mm (the point has a thickness of 2.9 mm). The object weighs 9.4 g.

The object is a mid brown in colour with an even patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst within the plough soil has resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb443),FIGURINE,UNKNOWN,"Description:

A small incomplete ceramic figurine. The artefact weighs 9.5g, has an incomplete height of 44.8mm, maximum width is 18.5mm and maximum thickness is 14.0mm.

The figurine is shown standing upright with the legs straight and together and the arms close to the side of the body bending forwards slightly from the elbow so that the hands rest just to the front of the upper thighs. The figurine was molded and a mould line can be clearly seen along the mid-line of both sides, over the arms and legs, and below the feet. Some damage has occured resulting in the loss of the head and the front half of one foot, the figurine's right foot. The hands are poorly formed almost as if they might have been designed to vanish into absent pockets. The fleshy legs and tummy have led to some speculation as to whether this was a purposeful attempt to represent fecundity. The clay has been fired in a relatively reduced atmosphere, the figurine having a dark brown to dark grey reduced body that becomes more oxidised, showing as a reddish orange, in the lower legs and particularly the ankle of the missing foot.

Discussion:

It has not been possible to securely date this artefact. The figurine recorded in PAS record BERK-20A867 seems to be extremely similar to this example. BERK-20A867 has been dated as Roman with the suggestion of a 2nd century AD date (See bibliographic references given in the BERK-20A867 record). However both Sally Worrell and Ralph Jackson assert that this example is definitely not a Roman figurine. This definite opinion has raised debate regarding the dating for BERK-20A867. Attempts to find a confirmed date within a different dating period is ongoing but currently no conclusive results have been found. Suggestions for a Post-Medieval (AD 1540-1900) date have been put forward based on the use of moulds for the manufacture of clay tobacco pipes.

Also see Taylor, A. A Roman lead coffin with pipeclay figurines from Arrington. Report 72. Interim Report. 1992 [pages 5-9 in the Specialists Report: Pipeclay figurines, by Miranda Green.

It is interesting to note that approximately 620 to 770 metres away from the find spot of CAM-3D41F9 Albion Archaeology excavated a Roman temple and burial ground. If this figurine was of a Roman date the representation of fecundity would not be out of place in a shrine or temple context.

It is important to remember that both CAM-3D41F9 and BERK-20A867 were found as stray surface finds.

The lower section of the object consists of a flattened oval which divides into a rectangular-sectioned forked or bifurcated terminal. The ends of the terminal have been squared off. The top section of the object is oval in cross-section with three further collars and a flattened sub-circular terminal. The object appears to be complete and has a dark brown patina. File marks are visible on the lower forked section of the object.  

Similar examples have been recorded on the PAS database, for examples see: BERK-B6DD03, HAMP-7DDDA8 and WILT-028CE8.

A similar object HAMP-A441B7 has been described to clay pipe expert David Higgins who stated that it could plausibly be a c. 17th-century pipe tamper. His argument is based on the reach of the claw end which might have only been sufficient for earlier, smaller pipe bowls. He has drawn the recorder's attention to another 'skeumorphic' object identified as a pipe tamper - one in the form of an adze illustrated in an 'adze' illustrated by F W Fairholt FSA in his 1859 publication 'Tobacco: Its History and Associations' (unknown page; ref. 9), (HAMP-A441B7).

There is a tree or cave wall emerging from the ground on the right-hand side of the scene and a curved canopy at the top made up of five large pellets. Standing on the ground beneath the canopy area, a male and female figure are depicted engaged in sexual intercourse. The female's buttocks are pressed against the tree/cave side, and she is supporting her weight on her right leg while the left leg is raised and supported by the cradling arm of the male. Her upper torso is leaning forward, kissing the male and her arms appear to be wrapped around either the upper torso of the male or at his neck and shoulders. The male stands on both feet, the right leg bent slightly back, his arm cradling the woman's left leg as his phallus penetrates the woman. The whole scene is surrounded by a rectangular border. The reverse is flat and undecorated with no indication of a mounting point. The object appears to be unfinished as a ragged edge of extra metal remains around the outer edge of the rectangle.

The plaque has a medium grey patina. It is 58.8mm long, 49.2mm and 10.1mm thick. it weighs 110.68gm.

It has also been suggested that these objects are brothel tokens, but they seem a little large.

The scene may portray the consummation of Aeneas and Dido in the cave during a hunt while caught in a storm.

Fragment from the bowl a clay tobacco pipe with fluted decoration on the bowl sides. Fluted decoration became popular from the late 18th century onwards and this particular style with quite narrow and closely spaced flutes dates from around 1820-1880.  This pipe had quite a short bowl with a plain lip above the flutes.  The maker's initials IS are moulded on the spur of the pipe; the 'I' being commonly used to represent a 'J' at this period.  This mark could refer to James Smith, who is recorded working at Eton, Buckinghamshire, from at least 1872-1903 (Oswald 1975, 161).  James Smith was the son of the pipemaker Robert Smith, born on 25 January 1843 and baptised on 3 March 1843 at St George's, Camberwell, Southwark (Parish Register).

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb450),CLAY PIPE (SMOKING),POST MEDIEVAL,"A fragment of the bowl of a clay tobacco pipe. Dr David Higgins comments:

Although the bowl is damaged, the incuse stamp on the back can clearly be read as SWINYARD / MAKER, the lettering being arranged in a circle around a central cross.  Stylistically, this is a mid-nineteenth century or later style of mark, and can be paralleled by the incuse J HYDE / GUILDFORD stamps around a six-arm star that were used by John Hyde (Higgins 1981, Fig 7.8), who was working in Guildford from 1859-93.  Earlier styles of stamp on the back of the bowl reading SWIN / YARD are known, but these have the text arranged in horizontal lines within a circular stamp, with scrolls or foliage above and below the lettering (Higgins 1981, Figs 7.7 and 7.9).  These were produced by William Swinyard of Guildford, who was born in 1790 and died in 1864 .  The Haslemere example could, therefore, be a later style of stamp used by the Guildford maker during the 1850s or early 1860s.  Alternatively, a later member of the family, also called William Swinyard, was working in Aldershot from about 1895-1926 and so this mark could have come from his workshop.  Until more examples are recorded it is hard to be sure, but my initial suggestion would be that this later style of mark is most likely belong to the Aldershot maker, and so to date from c1895-1926.",,,Chichester,Linchmere,51.08058277,-0.74511107,1895,,https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/medium/151075.JPG,Gardening,Returned to finder

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb453),UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT,MEDIEVAL,"A cast copper alloy artefact of uncertain function, probably Medieval or post-Medieval in date, AD 1400 - 1600. It is in the shape of a foot or boot which appears to be armoured, depicted from beneath the knee to the toe. A lozenge shaped loop projects from the top.

The leg is of roughly pentagonal section with a faceted front and rounded back. The sides are flat, the front and the top of the foot have two facets and the rear of the boot is slightly rounded. The toe of the foot is pointed, the sole is flat and there is a small, semi-circular cutout on each side to delineate the instep. At the top the boot is slanted from front to back so the front is taller. The boot is decorated with narrow, incised grooves. There is a single, central groove down each side of the leg and a single groove around the top of the boot just below the rim. There are then four sets of paired, chevron shaped grooves, one at the top and bottom of the reverse, one at the top of the front and one at the front just above the foot. There is a single chevron shaped groove just behind the toe of the foot. These grooves are possibly meant to represent armour. 

In the centre of the top edge is a flat projection. This projection has a central, mitre shaped (or lozenge shaped) extension, on either side of which is a crescent shaped curve rising to a rounded point at the front and the back. The central extension has a circular perforation through it; whether this is a pendant loop or intended to accommodate some form of pin or other link is unknown. The curving base of this tab may suggests that the object was designed to fold at this articulation. There is little wear on the circular hole, but it seems to be towards the front of the boot, not at the top of the hole.

The artefact has a smooth, dark green patina. It is 47.1mm long, 21.1mm wide and 8.1mm thick. It weighs 28.65gm.

No close parallel for this item has yet been found but there are two similar objects recorded on the database. See references KENT-072BFE and IOW-6C4165. These differ in having a rivet projecting from the top of the leg. Though recorded as unidentified, they are probably legs from a metal vessel such as a box or ewer. Ewer legs in the form of armoured legs are also recorde on the database. A good example, with many published examples cited, is CORN-7B3F50. Examples on the database are integrally cast with the vessel wall, part of which survives at the top of the leg, so they are different to this example. Other suggestions of function include a high quality articulated toy, a pipe tamper, or part of a folding candlestick, but it has not yet been possible to identify parallels. It could also be a decorative pendant, though the attahment loop looks more like an articulation than a suspension loop.",,,Leeds,Headingley,53.81958063,-1.5913624,1400,,https://finds.org.uk/images/acooper/medium/PAS_2558_leg.jpg,Building work,Returned to finder

It may be there here the pilgrim was given the opportunity to pick his own pendant from a variety of genre material and good luck tokens, thereby sometimes leading to the same juxtaposition of elements of piety and profanity that are to be found in The Canterbury Tales or on many misericords.""

This pipe is indicated by a raised line on the reverse. The obverse bears the inscription GRE/GORIVS./PP.VIIII. in three lines, within a pelleted border (omega above the 'P's; V for U). The 'PP' stands for 'Pastor Pastorum', translated as 'shepherd of the shepherds'.



The reverse bears the conventional stamped busts of Saints Peter and Paul both within drop-shaped pelleted borders, possibly haloes, which join to the outer pelleted border. On the left, St Paul's beard is portrayed as being long, straight and pointed, whilst his hair is straight and swept back. On the right, Peter looks left with his more rounded hair and beard both formed of pellets. Between the two is a cross with a long shaft. Above is the inscription: 'SPA [S]PE' (abbreviations for St Paul and St Peter).



The bulla is 37.3mm long by 37.6mm across, 5.2mm thick and weighs 43.97g.



The bulla has some indents and grooves from post depositional damage. Dr Tim Pestell notes of NMS-155876 that ""The bull is typical for those of Gregory IX in having an edge to the flan extending beyond the pelleted outer border on both the obverse and reverse."" This example is from a different die to NMS-155876 as it lacks the horizontal line under SPA. Bullae of Gregory IX account for at least 22 out of 347 examples of bulla currently on the PAS database.",,,Wiltshire,,,,1227,,https://finds.org.uk/images/elburnett/medium/SOM-82B474.JPG,Metal detector,Returned to finder

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb463),TOY,POST MEDIEVAL,"A large post medieval cast copper alloy composite possible pipe tamper with moving parts. This object is not certainly a tobacco pipe tamper as the lower projection has a rectangular section; pipe tampers tend to be rounded or oval. The object depicts a bawdy representation of a copulating couple who stand facing each other. The couple stand on a base from which projects a handle. Both partners are depicted in a somewhat naive and un-naturalistic fashion; the lower limbs of the male in particular are out of proportion to the torso, and the head is tiny in comparison to the remainder of the body. Two pairs of jointed arms, each forming a V, join the figures together. Each pair of arms is fixed to a round-section pin both of which run through the shoulders of both male and female. The couple stand on a flat rectangular platform which is decorated with incised crosses. Beneath the platform projects an integral narrowing plain column of rectangular section. At the base of this column is a wider, slightly tapering, element of rectangular section. There is an incised cross on each side of the latter and the lower face is also decorated, but with an incised grid of lines.



The female stands on the rectangular base, part of which has been rebated and then infilled with a separate square of metal to accommodate her. This infilling does not appear to be a repair as the incised lines cover the infilled plate. Between the female and this infilling is a second separate square plate, evidently provided to raise her further and from which a pin projects to keep the female figure in position (the female was loose when found, enabling this pin to be seen). The base of this pin can also be seen on the lower face of the platform on which she stands.



The female figure is predominantly rectangular in section, with rounded corners. She stands wearing a floor length dress which is drawn back to expose the lower part of the body below the waist. Her legs are divided by a wide tapering groove at the apex of which is a round hole which represents the vagina (and which is now plugged with a fragment of metal). Around the 'vagina' is an area of very thin curving lines intended to represent pubic hair. Transverse lines cross both knees and insteps. The folds of her pulled back dress are represented by four continuous wavy grooves which run down both sides of the body and across the torso. On her back is a series of ten deep and wide grooves; what these may represent is unclear. The upper part of the torso is left largely plain apart from a pair of incised grooves which run under the breasts to meet in a V on the back. The breasts are depicted as small, but prominent and pointed. Facial features comprise a single groove for the mouth and a pair of drilled pits for the eyes. The head itself is noticeably narrow. She wears a head covering which comprises a plain encircling band above which is a rounded form with three diagonal grooves. The 'hat' terminates in a rounded projection above the forehead.



The male figure comprises two separate main elements; the upper body element is attached into a deep fissure in the lower element by means of a separate pin. The lower part of the body (the legs below the waist) passes though a rectangular cut out on the platform on which the female stands and is fixed in position by means of a separate rivet which passes through his legs above the ankles and through the platform on either side. No attempt has been made to show separate legs. The male's booted feet with high heels project below the platform, giving the impression of this figure hanging in mid-air and this position results in the head of the male being positioned below the head of the female, although his body is in reality considerably longer. An encircling pair of wide collars at thigh height appears to represent the cuffs of thigh-length leather boots. There is a further group of four grooves on the sides of the legs, and a series of nine transverse grooves runs down the back of the legs, the lowest indicating a separate heel on the boots.



The upper part of the body terminates in a rounded rebated extension which fits into the lower element. He wears what appears to be a short waist length jacket; grooves represent the lines of the sloping collar and buttoned join, while another groove runs just above the coat's lower edge but does not continue to the front. Little of the man's head can be seen below a wide-brimmed cylindrical hat. As with the female, eyes and mouth are shown by drilled pits and a groove.



From a socket below the man's waist projects a separate rod which represents the man's erect penis. While the articulating waist and ankles are presently locked in position the figure of the male was clearly intended to rock back and forth to imitate sexual intercourse.



This object is not certainly a tobacco pipe tamper as the lower projection has a rectangular section; pipe tampers tend to be rounded or oval. A French origin has been suggested (Bernd Becker, pers. comm.). This object falls within a range of other bawdy objects, mainly pipe tampers, which were no doubt used to titillate and amuse.",,,Wokingham,Swallowfield,51.38835738,-0.95228708,1600,,https://finds.org.uk/images/dwilliams/medium/B14-291.JPG,Metal detector,Returned to finder

Homer, in Five Centuries of Base Metal Spoons (1975), categorises this type of spoon as seal top, baluster type.

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb477),TOY,POST MEDIEVAL,"An incomplete Post Medieval copper alloy toy musket, dating AD 1600-1640. This is a type 1, design 2 toy musket (Forsyth and Egan, 2005, 91). It is solidly cast, consisting of a fishtail butt, cylindrical barrel with three facets on the top, an open circular pan and a rectangular trigger guard. On the upper side of the musket, there is a ridge at the breech, curving around the open pan. Along the side of the barrel, next to the pan, is a pronounced semi-circular ridge. Half-way along the upper barrel are two pairs of transverse grooves, leaving a gap in the decoration. There is a muzzle ring formed of an engraved line. On the underside, there is another transverse groove near the muzzle, with a further two at the end of the stock. The two sets of engraving underneath are located next to ridges that mark the main body of the barrel. Forsyth and Egan note that these lower engravings may represent ramrod pipes (ibid.).



The stock is decorated with punched ring and dot motifs; three on either side of the butt, three along the stock and one underneath, just before the trigger guard. The top of the barrel is decorated with a wavy line running down the centre and scrolling decoration on the facets either side. The section between the sets of engraved lines is blank. The decoration has been formed using a circular stamp. The identical decoration is found in Egan and Forsyth (ibid.), dating the object to AD 1600-1640.

Henrietta Maria was a French Roman Catholic born in 1609 and married Charles I in 1625. She was the mother of Charles II. Research reveals that Henrietta, a Roman catholic in a then Protestant country, was not particularly popular with the people of England. It therefore possibly seems an unusual choice to have a pipe tamper commemorating her marriage to Charles I. She died in 1669, and the date range for this pipe tamper has therefore been given as between 1625 and 1669.

ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb486),CLAY PIPE (SMOKING),MODERN,"An incomplete clay pipe of Post Medieval date. The object consists of the bowl of a clay pipe and a fragment of the stem. The mouth of the bowl is decorated with a series of moulded ridges. There is a small round spur at the base of the bowl measuring 5.89mm in diameter. The pipe bowl is incomplete and has a skull and crossbones motif on each side and part of a motto underneath. The motto would originally have read either 'DEATH OR GLORY' or 'DEATH &amp; GLORY' (both versions occur and it's not clear which has been used here). This motif is, in fact, the emblem of the 17th Lancers, a regiment originally formed in 1759 and most famous for their 'Charge of the Light Brigade', which took place during the Crimean War at the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854. The motto of the 17th Lancers was 'Death or Glory' and pipes depicting this motif, sometimes with the motto as well, were one of the popular designs that were produced in the Manchester area at the end of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century.

The earliest surviving pipemakers catalogue from Manchester dates from around 1906 and was produced by Edward Pollock, whose business had been founded in 1879. This catalogue depicts two versions of the design, one with 'DEATH OR GLORY' underneath the skull and crossbones motif and '17th LANCERS' on the stem (Pattern No 58) and one with an identical motif but without any lettering in either location (Pattern No 95). Later examples of Pattern No 58 produced by Pollock's do not have either the stem lettering or pattern number on. Very similar patterns, also with the lettering 'DEATH OR GLORY' and '17th LANCERS', are shown in the catalogues of two other Manchester makers, Samuel McLardy (c1910; Pattern No 171) and Joseph Holland (c1915; Pattern No 25). A slightly later catalogue produced by McLardy around 1920 does not include this design (Jung 2003, 367-378), although Pollock's was still producing both versions until their business was moved from Manchester in 1994. The Pollock catalogue lists this design as the 'Death &amp; Glory' (sic), while the Mc Lardy and Holland name for it was '17th Lancers'. Although other firms in the area may well have made this pattern as well, these were the three largest manufacturers and, of the catalogue illustrations, only that of Holland shows a symbol mark in the form of a shield on the heel. The firm of Joseph Holland &amp; Sons was founded in 1845 and continued to manufacture pipes until February 1941 (June 2003, 213). Given the symbol mark on the heel, the Chester find is most likely to be a product of this firm, manufactured at some point between about 1880 and 1940.

This marked concentration suggests that this maker worked in or near Warrington, while the widespread distribution shows that he must have operated a large workshop that was able to market pipes over a wide area. This new find shows that his products were even able to compete against the prolific Chester makers and adds a useful additional find spot for his distribution pattern.

The pipe tamper is moulded in high relief on the outer surface and flattened lower relief on the reverse, but clearly is meant to be observed from both faces.  The moulded decoration suggests a woman standing with feet apart; she seems to be holding her dress or garments in her mouth, exposing her genitals between widely spaced legs.  The garments gather into her mouth and traces of her lips, almond-shaped eyes, pronounced nose and forehead are visible, beneath shoulder length hair and a possible hood.  Her arms are positioned tightly to her sides and in between her legs is what appears to be a phallus pointing upwards, possibly even a winged phallus, which has been identified in similar pipe tampers from this period (cf. PAS record SUR-94B6F7).  Below her feet and the phallus is a small triangular plinth and the remains of a cylindrical pipe tamper shaft.  The reverse of the object is similarly detailed, with a protruding curved hood peak or hair, followed by a small recessed portion which equates to her face on the other side; one raised horizontal ridge followed by five vertical ridges perpendicular to the first suggest her upper garments, whereas below this, pronounced buttocks emphasise her nudity.  Bare legs and lower arms are visible, with the space between her legs here a simple sub-triangular raised space.  The object measures 54.15 mm high, 17.58 mm maximum width, 11 mm maximum thickness and weighs 26.37 grams.

The key housing, most of the spout and key, and part of the pipe survive, the remainder now missing due to old breaks. The surviving length of the pipe is cylindrical in form measuring 9.60mm in external diameter (5.81mm in internal diameter). This extends to the integral key housing, which is octagonal in form with a central vertical aperture through which passes the key itself. At the outer edge is an integral but incomplete spout. This is seemingly zoomorphic in form with projecting triangular ears, multiple transverse grooves for the eyes and top of snout, with an open mouth that grips the incomplete cylindrical spout. The separately cast tap key is cylindrical in form with a flattened zoomorphic terminal. This is in the form of a bird, perhaps a cockerel or similar, with rectangular body, semi-circular head with pointed beak, and large but incomplete curving tail. The entire object measures 45.13mm in height, 46.70mm in length, 14.43mm in width/thickness, and 35.85g in weight.



This is an incomplete barrel tap and key of early Post-Medieval date. It finds parallels in a number of examples recorded through the PAS (e.g. NMS-D36F05, SF-17FC34, HAMP-60C2A2, SOM-901263, SOM-570193 or BERK-A3B3B5) and is of probable 16th-17th century AD date, if not slightly earlier.",,,Suffolk Coastal,,,,1450,,https://finds.org.uk/images/abrown/medium/GED_SF-07F127.jpg,Metal detector,Returned to finder
ObjectId(57da611885c5eb0da62cb490),PIPE TAMPER,POST MEDIEVAL,"A complete copper-alloy pipe tamper of the post-medieval period, dating to AD 1700 - AD 1800.



The tamper depicts an erotic scene. The scene consists of a standing couple, probably engaged in sexual intercourse. The two figures are positioned facing each other. The Male (larger) figure is standing upright, with his arms around the waist of the Female (slightly smaller) figure. The female has her legs bent and is leaning into the male figure, she appears to be partially seated, her arms are equally around the waist of the Male. The Male's arms are cast over the top of the Female's. Underneath the figures is a fluted column with cast incised lines resembling wood or bark on the surface, the tamper has a pedestal base. The tamper has been bent slightly towards the obverse, probably whilst in the plough soil



The tamper measures 66.2 mm in total (the figures are 38.5 mm in length and the column is 26.1 mm long), it is 13.9 mm wide and has a thickness of 6.9 mm. It weighs 18.9 g.



The tamper is a mid brown in colour with pateches of green, it has an uneven surface patina. Abrasion caused by movement whilst in the plough soil may have resulted in the loss of some of the original surface detail.



Bawdy scenes were important features of eighteenth-century popular art, literature, and material culture, and it is this tradition into which these tampers fit. A closely dated, complete parallel comes from the wreck of the Colossus, which sank in 1798.
